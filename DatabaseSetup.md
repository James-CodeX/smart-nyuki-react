# Database Setup Documentation

This document outlines the data structure used in the Smart-Nyuki React application. It provides a comprehensive guide for migrating from the current mock data implementation to a proper database in the future.

## Tables Overview

The application uses the following core data models:

1. **Apiaries** - Beekeeping locations that contain multiple hives
2. **Hives** - Individual beehives within apiaries
3. **Metrics** - Time-series data for hive measurements (temperature, humidity, etc.)
4. **Alerts** - Notifications about hive conditions requiring attention
5. **Inspections** - Records of hive inspections, both scheduled and completed
6. **Users** - System users who manage apiaries and hives
7. **HiveMetrics** - Specific time-series data for various metric types
8. **HiveProductionData** - Records of honey production and harvests
9. **ApiarySharing** - Manages access permissions between users for collaborative work

   - Many Apiaries belong to one User (owner)
   - Many Inspections are performed by one User
   - Many HiveProductionData records are associated with one Hive

3. **Many-to-Many Relationships:**
   - Users and Apiaries have a many-to-many relationship through ApiarySharing

## Mock Data Patterns

The application uses several patterns for generating mock data that should be considered when migrating to a real database:

1. **Time-Series Data Patterns:**
   - Temperature data follows a daily cycle (higher during day, lower at night)
   - Humidity is typically inverse to temperature (higher at night, lower during day)
   - Sound data is higher during active bee hours (8am-6pm)
   - Weight data shows gradual increase over time as nectar is collected

2. **Alert Generation:**
   - Alerts are generated when metrics exceed defined thresholds:
     - Temperature: < 31Â°C or > 37Â°C
     - Humidity: < 35% or > 70%

3. **Production Data:**
   - Yearly production ranges from 100-300kg per apiary
   - Monthly production ranges from 5-35kg per apiary
   - Individual hive production ranges from 5-35kg
   - Weight change rate is between -0.5 to 1.5 kg/day

4. **Inspection Types and Schedules:**
   - Regular inspections are typically every 7-14 days
   - Health checks are more frequent during active seasons
   - Winter prep inspections occur before cold weather
   - Harvest evaluations occur when honey is ready for collection
   - Varroa checks and disease treatments are scheduled as needed

## Indexes

To optimize query performance, consider the following indexes:

1. **Apiaries:**
   - Index on `user_id` for fast filtering of a user's apiaries
   - Spatial index on `(latitude, longitude)` for proximity searches

2. **Hives:**
   - Index on `apiary_id` for fast filtering of hives by apiary
   - Index on `status` for filtering hives by status

3. **HiveMetrics:**
   - Composite index on `(hive_id, type, timestamp)` for time-series queries
   - Index on `timestamp` for date range queries

4. **MetricsTimeSeriesData:**
   - Composite index on `(hive_id, timestamp)` for efficient retrieval of time series
   - Index on `timestamp` for time-range filtering

5. **Inspections:**
   - Index on `hive_id` for filtering inspections by hive
   - Index on `date` for date range queries
   - Index on `status` for filtering inspections by status
   - Index on `user_id` for filtering inspections by user

6. **HiveProductionData:**
   - Index on `hive_id` for filtering production by hive
   - Index on `apiary_id` for filtering production by apiary
   - Index on `date` for filtering by production date
   - Composite index on `(hive_id, date)` for time-series production queries

7. **ProductionSummary:**
   - Composite index on (`apiary_id`, `year`, `month`) for period-based reports

8. **ApiarySharing:**
   - Composite index on (`user_id`, `apiary_id`) for quick permission lookups
   - Index on `invitation_status` for filtering pending invitations

## Security and Access Control

To ensure data is accessed only by authenticated users and prevent data leakage, implement the following security measures:

### 1. Authentication System

| Table       | Type         | Description                              |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Sessions    | Table        | Stores active user sessions              |
| RefreshTokens | Table      | Stores tokens for session renewal        |
| LoginAttempts | Table      | Tracks login attempts for rate limiting  |
| TwoFactorAuth | Table      | Stores 2FA settings and backup codes     |

#### Sessions Table

| Column      | Type         | Constraints                  | Description                             |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| id          | VARCHAR(36)  | PRIMARY KEY                 | Unique identifier for the session       |
| user_id     | VARCHAR(36)  | FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL       | Associated user                         |
| token       | VARCHAR(255) | UNIQUE, NOT NULL            | Session token (JWT or similar)          |
| ip_address  | VARCHAR(45)  | NOT NULL                    | IP address used for session             |
| user_agent  | TEXT         | NOT NULL                    | Browser/client identification           |
| expires_at  | TIMESTAMP    | NOT NULL                    | Session expiration time                 |
| created_at  | TIMESTAMP    | NOT NULL                    | When the session was created            |
| last_active | TIMESTAMP    | NOT NULL                    | Last activity timestamp                 |

**Foreign Keys:**
- `user_id` references `Users(id)` ON DELETE CASCADE

### 2. Authorization Rules

1. **Multi-tenancy Enforcement:**
   - All data access must be filtered by user ownership
   - Direct object references should be avoided in APIs
   - Use parameterized queries with user context

2. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - Implement the following roles with appropriate permissions:
     - **Admin**: Full access to all data
     - **Beekeeper**: Access to owned apiaries and associated data
     - **Viewer**: Read-only access to specific apiaries (for collaboration)

3. **Row-Level Security:**
   - Database queries must include user_id filters
   - Implement database-level row security policies where supported

### 3. API Security Measures

1. **API Authentication:**
   - All API endpoints must require authentication
   - Use JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Add CSRF protection for browser clients

2. **API Request Flow:**
   ```
   Client Request â Auth Middleware â Validate Token â Check Permissions â Access Data
   ```

3. **Data Access Policies:**
   - Users can only access apiaries they own or have been granted access to
   - Metrics and production data inherit access rules from parent hives/apiaries
   - Implement a permission check helper function in all API controllers

### 4. Sample Database Queries with Security Context

```sql
-- Example: Retrieving apiaries with user context
SELECT * FROM Apiaries WHERE user_id = ?; -- user_id from authenticated session

-- Example: Retrieving shared apiaries 
SELECT a.* FROM Apiaries a
JOIN ApiarySharing s ON a.id = s.apiary_id
WHERE s.user_id = ? AND s.invitation_status = 'accepted';

-- Example: Retrieving hives with security check (including shared apiaries)
SELECT h.* FROM Hives h
JOIN Apiaries a ON h.apiary_id = a.id
WHERE a.user_id = ? -- user is owner
   OR EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM ApiarySharing s 
      WHERE s.apiary_id = a.id 
      AND s.user_id = ? 
      AND s.invitation_status = 'accepted'
   );

-- Example: Retrieving metrics with security check
SELECT m.* FROM HiveMetrics m
JOIN Hives h ON m.hive_id = h.id
JOIN Apiaries a ON h.apiary_id = a.id
WHERE a.user_id = ? -- user is owner
   OR EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM ApiarySharing s 
      WHERE s.apiary_id = a.id 
      AND s.user_id = ? 
      AND s.invitation_status = 'accepted'
   );

-- Example: Check if user has edit permission for an apiary
SELECT EXISTS (
   SELECT 1 FROM Apiaries a
   WHERE a.id = ? AND a.user_id = ?
   UNION
   SELECT 1 FROM ApiarySharing s
   WHERE s.apiary_id = ? AND s.user_id = ? 
   AND s.permission IN ('edit', 'manage')
   AND s.invitation_status = 'accepted'
) AS has_permission;
```

### 5. Audit and Monitoring

| Table       | Type         | Description                              |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| AuditLogs   | Table        | Records all significant data operations  |

#### AuditLogs Table

| Column      | Type         | Constraints                  | Description                             |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| id          | VARCHAR(36)  | PRIMARY KEY                 | Unique identifier for the log entry     |
| user_id     | VARCHAR(36)  | FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL       | User who performed the action           |
| action      | VARCHAR(50)  | NOT NULL                    | Action type (create, read, update, delete) |
| entity_type | VARCHAR(50)  | NOT NULL                    | Type of affected entity (Apiary, Hive, etc.) |
| entity_id   | VARCHAR(36)  | NOT NULL                    | ID of the affected entity               |
| details     | JSON         | NULL                        | Additional action details               |
| ip_address  | VARCHAR(45)  | NOT NULL                    | IP address of the user                  |
| timestamp   | TIMESTAMP    | NOT NULL                    | When the action occurred                |

**Foreign Keys:**
- `user_id` references `Users(id)`

**Indexes:**
- Index on `user_id` for filtering by user
- Index on `entity_type` and `entity_id` for filtering by entity
- Index on `timestamp` for time-based queries

### 6. Implementing Access Control in the Application Layer

1. **Authentication Flow:**
   - Implement a login page that's required before accessing any app content
   - Store JWTs in HTTP-only cookies to prevent client-side access
   - Include CSRF tokens in all state-changing requests
   - Use short expiration times with automatic token refresh
   - Implement separate service role authentication for ESP32 nodes

2. **Permission Verification Middleware:**
   - Create middleware that verifies user permissions before processing requests:

   ```typescript
   // Example middleware that checks for apiary access
   const verifyApiaryAccess = async (req, res, next) => {
     const { apiaryId } = req.params;
     const userId = req.user.id;
     const requiredPermission = req.method === 'GET' ? 'view' : 'edit';
     
     // Check if user is owner or has appropriate shared access
     const hasAccess = await db.checkApiaryAccess(apiaryId, userId, requiredPermission);
     
     if (!hasAccess) {
       return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied' });
     }
     
     next();
   };
   ```

3. **Frontend Access Controls:**
   - Implement UI-level permissions to hide actions that aren't allowed
   - Show clear visual indications of shared resources
   - Add permission checks to sensitive operations:

   ```typescript
   const OwnershipBadge = ({ apiary }) => {
     const { user } = useAuth();
     const isOwner = apiary.user_id === user.id;
     
     if (isOwner) {
       return <Badge variant="primary">Owner</Badge>;
     }
     
     return (
       <Badge variant="secondary">
         {apiary.permission === 'edit' ? 'Can Edit' : 'Viewer'}
       </Badge>
     );
   };
   ```

4. **Handling Shared Resources:**
   - Create a clear invitation and acceptance workflow
   - Allow owners to revoke access at any time
   - Provide visibility into who has access to what resources
   - Ensure all child resources inherit parent permissions

5. **IoT Device Authentication and Access Control:**
   - ESP32 nodes use a dedicated service role for authentication
   - Nodes are associated with hives during the hive setup process
   - The row-level security policies for metrics data are based on hive ownership
   - Users can view metrics data for hives they own or have been granted access to
   - Implement a secure provisioning process for ESP32 nodes:

   ```typescript
   // Example of associating an ESP32 node with a hive
   const associateNodeWithHive = async (req, res) => {
     const { hiveId, nodeId } = req.body;
     const userId = req.user.id;
     
     // Verify the user owns the hive
     const hiveOwnership = await db.verifyHiveOwnership(hiveId, userId);
     
     if (!hiveOwnership) {
       return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Not authorized to configure this hive' });
     }
     
     // Register the node ID with the hive
     await db.updateHive(hiveId, { node_id: nodeId });
     
     // Generate and store node-specific credentials if needed
     // ...
     
     return res.status(200).json({ message: 'Node successfully associated with hive' });
   };
   ```

## Data Migration Considerations

When migrating from mock data to a real database:

1. **Primary Keys:**
   - The mock data uses string IDs (like "apiary-1" and "hive-{apiaryId}-{number}"). Consider UUID approach or auto-incremented integers.

2. **Date/Time Handling:**
   - The mock data stores dates as ISO strings. Ensure proper conversion to database date types.
   - Time-series data is stored with time points in "HH:mm" format - consider standardizing to timestamps.

3. **Enum Types:**
   - Use proper database-specific ENUM types or reference tables for status and type fields.

4. **Initial Data:**
   - Create scripts to convert mock data to database seed data.
   - Generate initial data based on patterns found in the mock data (daily cycles for temperature, etc.)

5. **Metrics Storage:**
   - Consider time-series database options for metrics data if volume grows significantly.
   - Potential time-series partitioning for metrics table.
   - The current implementation generates metrics with natural patterns (temperature higher during day, etc.) - maintain these patterns when migrating.

6. **Soft Deletes:**
   - Add `deleted_at` timestamp fields to implement soft deletes if needed.

7. **API Authentication:**
   - Implement proper user authentication with JWT or session-based auth.

8. **Data Validation:**
   - Implement validation rules based on current business logic (e.g., inspection findings using 0-5 scales)

## Backend API Structure

Implement REST API endpoints for each entity:

- `/api/auth` - Authentication endpoints (login, logout, refresh)
- `/api/users` - User management
- `/api/apiaries` - Apiary management
- `/api/apiaries/{id}/hives` - Hive management within an apiary
- `/api/hives/{id}/metrics` - Metrics for a specific hive
- `/api/hives/{id}/alerts` - Alerts for a specific hive
- `/api/hives/{id}/inspections` - Inspections for a specific hive
- `/api/inspections/{id}/findings` - Findings for a specific inspection
- `/api/hives/{id}/production` - Production data for a specific hive
- `/api/inspections/scheduled` - Get all scheduled inspections
- `/api/inspections/overdue` - Get all overdue inspections
- `/api/inspections/upcoming?days=7` - Get upcoming inspections for next N days
- `/api/production/summary?period=year` - Get production summaries by period
- `/api/metrics/aggregate?type=temperature&period=day` - Get aggregated metrics
- `/api/apiaries/{id}/sharing` - Manage access permissions for an apiary
- `/api/sharing/invitations` - List and respond to sharing invitations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Permissions System:**
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Allow sharing apiaries between users

2. **Automated Alerts:**
   - Implement background jobs to analyze metrics and create alerts
   - Set up threshold configuration for different alert types

3. **Data Retention Policy:**
   - Implement data aggregation for older metrics data
   - Consider archiving or pruning old data

4. **API Versioning:**
   - Implement API versioning for future compatibility

5. **File Storage:**
   - Add support for storing inspection photos, documents, etc.

6. **Audit Trail:**
   - Implement detailed audit logging for data changes

7. **Predictive Analytics:**
   - Build on the time-series data to implement predictive analytics
   - Forecast honey production based on historical data
   - Predict maintenance needs based on hive conditions

8. **Mobile Integration:**
   - Design database schema with mobile synchronization in mind
   - Implement offline-first capability for field inspections

9. **Weather Data Integration:**
   - Add support for correlating hive metrics with local weather data
